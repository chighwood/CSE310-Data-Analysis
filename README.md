# Overview

I am wanting to go into Data Anyalytics so this was a little project to start me off using datafiles to introduce me to future projects I might have.

I have become interested in stocks over the last year so I chose the an S&P500 dataset to go over and extract information from. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks?resource=download

Writing this software helped me to learn how to take raw data and access it using different types of libraries to compare and extract needed information.

# Data Analysis Results

Question 1: Which company has the highest revenue growth rate?

Question 2: Which sector has the highest average market capitalization?

OPTIONAL Question and graph: What are the average market cap by sectors?

# Development Environment

Used tools such as Youtube for information and recording.

Ued python to write the code in while using PANDAS for my dataset library and also matplotlib for my visual graph.
